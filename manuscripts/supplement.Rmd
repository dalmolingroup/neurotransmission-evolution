abstract: |
  Model uncertainty and limited data are fundamental challenges to
  robust management of human intervention in a natural system.
  These challenges are acutely highlighted by concerns that
  many ecological systems may contain tipping points, such as
  Allee population sizes.  Before a collapse, we do not know
  where the tipping points lie, if they exist at all.  Hence,
  we know neither a complete model of the system dynamics nor
  do we have access to data in some large region of state-space
  where such a tipping point might exist.
